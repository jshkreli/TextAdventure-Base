An example that offers ideas on how to get started with a JavaScript-based HTML5 text adventure game.

Haunted House Dream

The character is in a haunted house. They are trapped trying to get out. They have no items in their possession. In each room, they must find the item necessary to advance in the game. 

At the beginning of the game, the character has the choice to pick up a key.

The player will move through different rooms. Each room has a different environment. Some rooms may have zombies, ghosts, clowns, monsters, etc. The player will have a health property and the ability to pick up a first aid kit. 

List the various actions that a user will be able to take in your game. Not every action must be available at all times in the game - for example, if there is nothing to pick up in a particular room, then the "pickup" or "take" action might not be available.

pickup
health
drop
quit
revive

There will be a specific amount of levels that the user must finish. The last level, room, will be the most difficult to finish with multiple obstacles. When the user finishes the level, the game was all a dream and they wake up. 
When they type quit, the message "You were startled by something that woke you up from your nightmare."
